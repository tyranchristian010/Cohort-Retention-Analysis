# Cohort-Retention-Analysis
A cohort analysis of an online retail dataset was conducted using SQL to understand customers' trends and patterns over time. Cohort Analysis is a form of behavioral analytics that takes data from a given subset, and breaks it down into related groups. The project aims to demonstrate the implementation of the following skills:

* Handling missing values 
* Extracting Month from date
* Assign cohort to a transaction 
* Assigning cohort Index to each transaction 
* Create cohort table for retention rate 
* Interpret the retention rate
* Visualize the cohort table using Tableau

The data set we will be using comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
