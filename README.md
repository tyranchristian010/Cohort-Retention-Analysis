# Cohort-Retention-Analysis
In this project, we will conduct an analysis of an online retail dataset by executing a retention cohort analysis through the use of SQL and Tableau. A cohort is a group of individuals who have undergone a common experience within a specific time frame. Cohort Analysis is a valuable technique that enables the extraction of actionable insights related to customer churn, product engagement, product value, and other relevant metrics. Regardless of the technology or domain, Cohort Analysis provides robust data evaluation capabilities. We will employ a variety of SQL techniques in order to:

Handle missing values 
Extract Month from date
Assign cohort to a transaction 
Assigning cohort Index to each transaction 
Create cohort table for retention rate 
Interpret the retention rate
Visualize the cohort table using Tableau

The data set we will be using comes from the UCI Machine Learning repository. This is a transnational data set which contains all the transactions occurring between 01/12/2010 and 09/12/2011 for a UK-based and registered non-store online retail. The company mainly sells unique all-occasion gifts. Many customers of the company are wholesalers.
